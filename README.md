## 📌 How the Game Works
- The program randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
- The player chooses a difficulty level.
- The player gets a limited number of attempts based on the selected difficulty.
- After each wrong guess, a hint is given.
- The game ends when the player guesses correctly or runs out of attempts.
